# # ☁️ Infrastructure as Code with Terraform & AWS

This project demonstrates how to provision and manage cloud infrastructure on AWS using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). It is designed as a continuation of our CI/CD security pipeline project, adding automated deployment and scalability using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## 🌍 Overview

We use Terraform to define and provision the following AWS resources:

- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Subnets and Route Tables
- EC2 Instances or ECS Services (for hosting containers)
- Security Groups and IAM Roles
- S3 Buckets for artifact storage (optional)
- ALB (Application Load Balancer) for traffic routing

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code
- **AWS** – Cloud provider
- **Docker** – Container platform (if used with ECS)
- **GitHub** – Source code and pipeline trigger

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Prerequisites**  
   - [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)
   - AWS CLI configured with access keys

2. **Initialize Terraform**
   ```bash
   terraform init
Plan Infrastructure
Apply Configuration
Destroy (if needed)
terraform destroy

## 🔐 Security Practices
Sensitive variables (like AWS secrets) should be managed via environment variables or secret managers.

IAM roles and policies follow the principle of least privilege.

Resources are provisioned in isolated subnets with controlled ingress/egress rules.

## 💡 Goals
Learn and apply Infrastructure as Code principles.

Build secure, scalable AWS environments for real-world projects.

Integrate infrastructure provisioning into CI/CD pipelines (future step).
